### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and find great destinations.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice.
        Underneath there is a slider showing destinations with a "Explore" Call to action button (See image below). Which takes you to the desired destination.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has several options, click the call to action button or scroll down. By scrolling down where the user will find favourite destinations. By clicking the picture the user will be taken to the destination


    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid. At the top of the page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what page they will end up at.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the destination page you are presented with favourite places. By clicking the image the location will be shown on the map.

### Deployment

The current deployment of this project was done using gitpod.

I used the gitpod interface to write the code and as it is linked with github as it was easy to use the terminal to commit my files and push to my repository.

The deployed website is hosted on github pages for easy viewing without having to clone or fork the repository to view the running website.
Deployment was done by clicking on the settings tab on my repository then navigating to "Github pages"
Changing the source from none to master, this then deployed a link that can be found here : https://github.com/andersfalt/milestone-2

If you wish to run this project locally.
